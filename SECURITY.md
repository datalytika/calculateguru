# Reporting Security Issues

The project's team and community take issues of security or vulnerability very seriously.

We acknowledge your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will take every possible measure to correct and acknowledge your contributions.
To report a security issue, go to the project's issues and create a new issue.

If your report has data that can make this project vulnerable or will enable access to restricted areas, please consider sending an email to joseph.lweya@gmail.com. Please quote "SECURITY CALCULATEGURU" in the subject line.
