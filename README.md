## ü§î **What is this repo all about?**

* This repo is a collection of, summarily, calculators. The solutions here can be used in web apps to facilitate back-end calculations eg; mortgage interest calculators for lenders websites.
* We plan to make this repo easy to maintain and navigate by documenting all builds here in this README.md section.
* For example; the table of contents below will have a link to the specific folder and a description of what the file is all about.
* All the markdown follows ["MarkdownLint" rules](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint)!
* Make the _community healthier_ with all the guides like code of conduct, contributing, support, security... I'll assume we have a basic idea of how to use git. Well, I'll share some steps below.

## ‚ö° **Contributing**

If you want to contribute to this project and make it better, your help is very welcome. There are no special instructions on how to contribute to this project, but I'll note down steps if you're new to git.

### How to make a clean pull request

- Create a personal fork of this project on Github. [Click me to fork this project now](https://github.com/datalytika/calculateguru/fork).
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called `origin`.
- Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a **new branch** to work on! Branch from `develop` if it exists as you read this, but I don't think we'll apply that here so just branch from `master`.
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
- You'll have to add or change the documentation as needed after you contribute. The documentation is not so special for this project - there's a 'table of contents' at the bottom of this README.md. Follow the script as earlier contributions have done. Just link to the folder and a description of what your build does. We'll do this in alphabetical order.
- At times you have many commits. Squash them into one commit with git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase). Create a new branch if necessary.
- Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote `origin`.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target this project's `develop` branch if it exists as you read this. If not, go for`master`!
- ‚Ä¶
- If the project's patron ;), currently [Lweya Joe](https://github.com/lweyajoe), requests further changes, just push them to your branch. 
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete
your extra branch(es).

‚ö†Ô∏è _Please, let's ensure our commit messages are in present tense. A commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code ‚Äì not what you did to the code._ ‚ö†Ô∏è

‚ö†Ô∏è _Please, note that your sub-project can have its own README.md and documentation. It's good practice. Your README.md would obviously be inside your project's folder._ ‚ö†Ô∏è

‚ö†Ô∏è _Some contributors would like to share screenshots of tests on their build. Please do not upload image files to the repo. We recommend all images to be shared as links to [imgur](https://imgur.com)_ ‚ö†Ô∏è
